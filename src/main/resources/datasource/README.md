# About datasource

To avoid legal problems, we generate data using dummy names. The dummy names are generated by a free tool named FauxID[1] or copied from SNB.

- person names: person names generation is kinda complicated. So we refer to the SNB DataGen[2]
- company names: dummy names generated by fake-company-generator on Fauxid[3]
