# About Resources

Here we list the resources used in the Data Generation. There are three typical kinds of resourses here.

- Dictionaries: some raw data used as dictionaries to generate data, e.g. dummy names.
- Distributions: distributions that describes the degree distribution.
- Parameters: the parameters that used to define some common configurations or limits in data generation process.

## Dictionaries

To avoid legal problems, we generate data using dummy names. The dummy names are generated by a free tool named
FauxID[1] or copied from SNB.

| Dictionary Files | Description                                                     |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| accountTypes.txt | the account types' values generated with ChatGPT[2]             |
| companyNames.txt | dummy names generated by fake-company-generator[3] on Fauxid[1] |
| mediumNames.txt  | medium types generated with ChatGPT[2]                          |
| surnames.txt     | surnames of persons used in SNB DataGen[4]                      |

## Distributions

The distributions will be determined based on the real financial data profiling.

| Distribution Files              | Description                                                             |

| hourDistribution.dat            | the distribution of the hour of the day                                 |
| inDegreeRegression.txt          | the inDegree distribution in profiling results                          |
| multiplicity.txt                | the multiplicity in profiling results                                   |
| outDegreeRegression.txt         | the outDegree distribution in profiling results                         |
| powerLawAcitivityDeleteDate.txt | the powerlaw distribution to generate deleteDate used in SNB DataGen[4] |

## Parameters

Here are some configuration and parameters used in data generation including,

- params_default.ini: some common/gloabl parameters by default
- scale_factors.xml: a parameter map from the scale factors to the parameters that controls the data scale in
  generation.
